In 1831, NYU’s founders set out to create a new kind of university, one that matched New York City’s growing demands and demographics; a university that was different by design. Today, no other university engages the world like NYU does, with our own campuses, faculty members, students, and staff generating knowledge and discoveries in intellectual hubs around the globe. Continuing a legacy of global engagement and scholarship, we’re proud to foster a university-wide culture of access, equity, and inclusion. The Office of Global Inclusion, Diversity, and Strategic Innovation (OGI) provides expert consultation, resources, and innovative strategies to help guide the university toward a more inclusive future. We are committed to helping students, faculty, staff, and alums discover and engage with a holistic range of resources at NYU. In addition to ourcenters and communities, OGI is part of a broad spectrum of programs and services that span across the following partners at the university level, with additional resources housed within NYU schools, including: Learn more about the work OGI doesto fulfill NYU's commitment to building and strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion in research, scholarship, and learning across our University community.

NYU is committed to building a culture that respects and embraces diversity, inclusion, and equity, believing that these values – in all their facets – are, as President Andrew Hamilton said,“…not only important to cherish for their own sake, but because they are also vital for advancing knowledge, sparking innovation, and creating sustainable communities.They should be indispensable elements of an NYU education on all of our campuses. A diverse population encounters and appreciates all perspectives of an issue with a wealth of different approaches to confront it. The result is a higher quality of debate, and a more excellent and advanced academic enterprise.” NYU’s past is not without blemish when it comes to its commitment to diversity and inclusion; in spite of some strides since NYU’s founding, we have fallen short.  Awareness of this history makes us more committed to taking concrete steps to build an institution that truly recognizes the contributions of all its members. As NYU’s Provost, Katherine Fleming, said in a September 2016 equity, diversity, and inclusion event, “NYU Together”: “Cosmopolitanism at NYU doesn’t simply mean that we should have as diverse a student body, a faculty, and a staff as possible – obviously, we should have all those things.  But once such a diverse group comes together and forms a community, it is not sufficient for everyone here to feel as though they contributed as part of ‘this category’ or ‘that category.’  Instead, we ought to work hard to make this a community where everyone has a truly cosmopolitan mindset – as part of the broadest possible understanding that we can have about what humankind is.  And to really make diversity, equity, and inclusion come about, we have an obligation to make all people feel comfortable in that space, because we have defined our community in the broadest possible way.” NYU faculty, students, administrators, and staff should be fully committed to a vision of equity, diversity, and inclusion at NYU that encompasses that idea, and that by being in some of the world’s greatest and most diverse urban centers, NYU has an opportunity to lead. Such a commitment in word and in deed would be in line with NYU’s mission, history, understanding of excellence in the 21stcentury, and our aspirations to produce leaders in all fields. In New York and on its campuses and locations throughout the world, NYU is committed to:
