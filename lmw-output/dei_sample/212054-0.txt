request information apply Created in 1891 as an institution of higher learning uniquely suited to meet the needs of both a rapidly growing industrial society and of the young people seeking their place in it, Drexel University is committed to our founder A.J. Drexel's vision of a university that admits students regardless of gender, race, religion, and economic status and uniquely prepares them to enter the workforce. This vision has set the tone for us as a university committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all based on integrity, trust, and respect. At Drexel, our definition of diversity includes both individual differences (personality, values, attitudes, etc.) and other identifiers that make us unique. Our supportive community is built on celebrating diversity, equality, fairness, and inclusion, where every member is given opportunities to share their unique perspective with others and feel a sense of belonging. While Dragons come from all over the globe, we are united as one community. Through numerous initiatives, programs, and offerings, we are cultivating a more inclusive university dedicated to fostering, celebrating, and protecting our diverse community of students, faculty, and professional staff. In particular, some of our student-facing resources include those offered by theCenter for Black Culture (CBC),Student Center for Diversity and Inclusion (SCDI), and theCenter for Inclusive Education and Scholarship (CIES).
