From move-in day to the first day of classes and beyond, feeling a sense of belonging takes different amounts of time for everyone. Move-In Dayat Holy Cross is often accompanied by excitement mixed with a few nerves for first-year students. When all the boxes of clothes and supplies are emptied and families return home, students turn to another hurdle: feeling like they belong. The journey ofbelongingis different for each student.
