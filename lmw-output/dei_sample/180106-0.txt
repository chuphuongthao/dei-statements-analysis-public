The Carroll community is enriched by the opportunities we have to learn from diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. We are committed to embracing and expanding those opportunities as a core part of the Carroll experience. That commitment is rooted in our very identity. As a proudly Catholic, diocesan institution of higher education, we are firmly committed to the dignity of every person. And our educational foundation in the liberal arts—where multiple perspectives are key—invites diversity of thought. Finally, diversity in our living and learning community is essential to prepare students to succeed in a multicultural world. The Accessibility Services Office ensures that students with disabilities can fully enjoy the Carroll experience throughout their college careers. Carroll College strictly adheres to Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex or gender.
