It’s not just about making opportunities available to all; we believe by doing so, we enrich the lives of all. Tufts has always aimed to be inclusive. The university’s Universalist founders envisioned an institution that would embrace those at the margins of society, and offer admission to students from all cultures, religions, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Today, we remain as committed as ever to these principles by striving to recruit, retain, and nurture a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff, and by fostering the cultural competence and attitudes necessary to support and sustain healthy and productive interactions both within and beyond such a diverse university community. Through the many initiatives underway at Tufts, and a firm commitment to financial aid, our goal is to build and strengthen the university’s legacy of diversity and inclusion. As it has from the start, Tufts educates students from all backgrounds and identities in an environment that encourages open dialogue across many different perspectives. It is imperative that we continue to uphold these values, since what our students and alums bring to an increasingly interconnected and diverse world is strengthened by the experiences they have at Tufts.  Our interactive diversity dashboard helps raise awareness of inclusion as a university priority, enables us to celebrate our achievements, and illuminates areas for improvement.
