Created in 2021, our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee is dedicated to providing an equitable and supportive environment to all members of the University community regardless of their identities. Our DEI efforts are set to enhance and assess inclusivity in existing initiatives. Additionally, the DEI Committee aims to positively impact our campus by providing educational and professional development opportunities that aid in fostering an understanding of common humanity, while promoting personal growth among our community members at the student, faculty, staff, and administrative level.
