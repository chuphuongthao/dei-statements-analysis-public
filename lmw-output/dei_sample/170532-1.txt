 Our students come from around the world and around the country, bringing with them a wide array of identities and experiences. K is committed to providing a welcoming, safe and supportive environment for people of different backgrounds and perspectives as well as fostering a campus climate and academic experience in which our diverse community of learners can thrive. At K, we encourage you to get involved in activities and organizations that help you foster connections, nurture your passions, and engage with others whose experiences and perspectives are different from your own. As your K education prepares you to “better understand, live successfully within, and provide enlightened leadership to a richly diverse and increasingly complex world,” we hope that you will graduate equipped to not only navigate a world that is diverse and complex, but to change it for the better.

The College is greatly enriched by the multitudes of identities represented in our campus community. While intersectionality is integrated into every aspect of life at K, the College has several campus-wide traditions that celebrate diversity. Ten multicultural student organizations come together each year to showcase their cultures at Afro Fiesta Desi Sol, transforming the Hicks Student Center into a stage for student performances and a buffet of international food. Organized by Asian and Pacific Islander student groups on campus, Night Market is an annual event featuring modern and traditional music, dance, poetry and fashion performances. Sponsored by Kaleidoscope, an LGBTQ+ student organization, Pride Ball is an annual party celebrating queer culture where students are invited to challenge gender norms for a fun night of music, fashion, and drag performances.
