Call to Action Advancing diversity, equity and inclusion is not the responsibility of a single campus unit, but of the entire campus community.Our collaborative work must form a solid foundation for all we do:teaching, research, development, leadership, mentorship, supervision, innovationandservice. Building onshared equity leadership, academic and administrative units are creating action plans to support student, staff and faculty success. Action Planning Status Creating and sustaining a more inclusive community and supporting students, staff and faculty Since 2022, campus units have been working to advance equity and inclusion by building competence, confronting oppressive structures and identifying resources required for campuswide organizational change一core investments whose absence has hampered meaningful progress. Throughshared equity leadership, units are creating action plans to support student, staff and faculty success. Why? Because only through honesty, reflection, action and long-term commitment as Colorado's leading public research university can we confront the challenges that have impeded our ability to create and sustain a more inclusive campus environment for everyone. Our initiatives should better support the recruitment, retention and academic and professional development of all students and employees, including: People with disabilities Neurodivergent individuals People who identify as LGBTQ+ Women-identified people People from marginalized racial and ethnic groups First-generation scholars  Employee skills and development  Student achievement outcomes  Community building  Employee recruitment outcomes  Preparing students to participate in a diverse democracy Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Goals  University of Colorado Boulder © Regents of the University of Colorado Privacy•Legal & Trademarks•Campus Map University of Colorado Boulder © Regents of the University of Colorado
