We believe that diversity is invaluable because it: Seton Hill University is fully committed to providing an inclusive learning environment for members of the campus community, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, genetic information, age, marital status, familial status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or veteran status. Here, we see diversity and diverse perspectives as strengths, opportunities for learning, and keys to a productive working environment and the future growth of the University. Throughout the year, the University hosts cultural events and trainings to promote cross-culture learning and inclusion. Guest speakers frequent our campus to highlight the importance of embracing one another’s differences. Seton Hill is committed to a constant expansion of acceptance and learning for everyone who visits, attends and teaches here. In early 2020, Seton Hill President Dr. Mary Finger called for the creation of a Task Force on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. This task force will review institutional practices as they relate to diversity and inclusion, enhance existing programs and policies, and create new concrete measures that confront racism and exclusion to advance the University as an anti-racist, inclusive community.
