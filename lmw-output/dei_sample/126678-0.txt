The cross disciplinary perspective of a liberal-arts education offers unparalleled opportunities for intercultural engagement. Personal interactions, in and outside of the classroom promote exposure to diverse social environments where students engage in dialogue about new ideas and complex issues. In this academic and social environment, students become more adept at understanding multiple perspectives and more capable of critical thinking in ways that enhance perspective, quality of life, and success in a diverse world of work and community.  Colorado College values all persons and seeks to learn from their diverse experiences and perspectives. Achieving diversity of origin and thought is critical to fulfilling the College's aim to provide a liberal arts education that is among the finest in the country. Students, faculty, and staff work together to instigate, coordinate, and support diversity issues among all members of the CC community.
