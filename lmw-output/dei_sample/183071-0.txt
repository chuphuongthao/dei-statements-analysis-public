A sexual misconduct climate survey with a series of standard base questions was distributed to all undergraduate and graduate students in the state of New Hampshire as a required component of a new law aimed at addressing campus sexual misconduct. Spring 2022 was the first time it was conducted, and the results will be an important component in the university’s ongoing work to prevent and respond to all forms of sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence. The following survey and responses are specific to UNH Manchester. Every allegation of sexual misconduct is disturbing. When reviewing the summary findings, please note that the definition of sexual misconduct as it relates to this survey is quite broad, so it is important to read the survey questions and responses in their entirety to best understand the results.For example, one of the findings was that 25% of participants reported experiencing at least one incident of sexual harassment by a faculty or staff member. That is an alarming statistic. The actual question, however, provides context and shows that some of the 25% is made up of students who checked yes to the following: I was treated differently because of my sex or gender identity, the faculty or staff displayed or used sexist materials in class, the faculty or staff was condescending to me because of my sex or gender, etc. Working to prevent and respond to all forms of sexual misconduct and interpersonal violence is an ongoing commitment at UNH. Our 22 concrete steps to do so can be foundhereas well as their status and timeline for completion.
