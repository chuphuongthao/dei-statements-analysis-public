This camaraderie eased my university transition significantly.”Jeffrey Brown, A'23Marine Veteran and B.A. in International Security Studies AlumnusRead Jeffrey's StorySupport Resources Related to Middle East CrisisEvents and GuidanceAs President Gormley stated in his letter to the campus in October, our role as a
                                             Catholic and Spiritan university, with profound concern for moral and spiritual values
                                             and commitment to maintaining an ecumenical atmosphere, compels us to denounce extremist
                                             ideology in all its forms, and acts of violence carried out in its service. The tragic
                                             loss of innocent life in Israel and Gaza strengthens our resolve to teach values of
                                             peace and community.As the President also stated in the same letter, we’re uncertain about how the situation
                                             will resolve, but our first duty is to care for our students and our community. The
                                             Center for Student Wellbeing and Spiritan Campus Ministry remain important resources
                                             for those who may need it and are ready to help. Since October 7, 2023, staff in Duquesne’s
                                             various offices and operations have continued to connect with students and others
                                             to provide support as the horrendous situation in Israel and Gaza continues. Our priority
                                             has been, and remains, the safety and wellbeing of all members of our community, knowing
                                             that the crisis affects many people in a range of ways.Additionally, we encourage students to seek out loved ones, friends, faith leaders
                                             or other professionals, as further sources of support. Faith communities in Pittsburgh—
                                             Jewish, Muslim, Christian and others—are available and welcoming for those who wish
                                             to connect with them.As we confront the enormity of the violence and horror occurring there, our approach
                                             has been consistent with the University’s mission, to respect each human life and
                                             to provide safe and secure ways for members of our broad campus community to engage
                                             respectfully with one another.The loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is dreadful and appalling, and
                                             has sent shock waves across global communities as well as our own. Since October 7,
                                             the Division of Student Life has personally contacted students with connections to
                                             the region as well as Jewish and Muslim student organizations. The Center for Global
                                             Engagement has been in touch with other international students from the general region.
                                             The Center for Student Wellbeing has taken steps to serve students currently suffering,
                                             and they have been mindful to check with individuals they serve to see if the atrocities
                                             are having any compounding effect on their mental health.In the coming days, several activities have been planned at the request of a wide
                                             range of students looking to understand, learn, and potentially support those impacted.
                                             Those events include:The Political Science Club and Pi Sigma Alpha, with Professors Irwin, Hass, and Bobb
