Race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, religion: Fordham is committed to diversity in all dimensions. Working to understand and respect that which makes each of us unique is an essential part of a college education and part of our Jesuit mission. Race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, religion: Fordham is committed to diversity in all dimensions. Working to understand and respect that which makes each of us unique is an essential part of a college education. It’s part of our Jesuit mission, to be both Catholic and catholic: a community that welcomes and honors all who come to us—whether as students, faculty members, or members of our staff. Together we must work ever harder to create a community where every single one of us knows, at our core, that we belong here.
