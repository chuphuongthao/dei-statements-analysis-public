Popular Searches At the University of Mount Union, diversity is firmly rooted in the University’s mission to prepare students for fulfilling lives, meaningful work, and responsible citizenship.   At the University of Mount Union, we continuously strive to welcome, accept, and respect all people. We believe that through the union of disparate perspectives, we strengthen our community, facilitate global enlightenment, and enable collective self-discovery. As such, we embrace diversity and inclusiveness to facilitate the development of ideas, the advancement of global perspectives, and to create a greater understanding and acceptance of all people. We actively promote a diverse and inclusive environment that obliges mutual respect and positive engagement to effectively enrich learning and living for our students, faculty, staff, administration, and community. As members of the University of Mount Union community, we pledge to: The University of Mount Union sits on land once inhabited by the Osage, Kaskaskia, Hopewell, Wyandotte, Erie, Seneca, and Delaware tribes as well as countless other tribal nations who left Ohio Country through violent forced migration. Our students and professors learn and teach on land that was home to many indigenous tribes filled with people who have a vibrant history, culture, and spiritual practices. Indigenous families called Ohio Country home and shaped the land for centuries and many of their descendants live and work in Ohio today. It is important for us to remember the origin of the land and the people who cultivated it. We commit to honoring Native Americans through curriculum, service, and relationship-building. As RAIDERS we celebrate and uphold diversity by: We stand united with integrity, transparency, and openness so that we continue to work together to create an environment that is both diverse and inclusive. The guiding REACH principles (Respect, Equity, Acknowledge, Culture, and History) will cultivate inclusive attitudes for us to REACH our fullest potential as RAIDERS.  Incidents of bias, harassment, and discrimination undermine our efforts to create an inclusive campus that welcomes everyone. We are committed to maintaining an environment that values equity, inclusion, and mutual respect.
