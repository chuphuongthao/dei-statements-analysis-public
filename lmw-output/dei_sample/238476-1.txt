The Carthage community is committed to fostering integrity, civility, and justice. Aiming to learn from each other, we reject all forms of prejudice and discrimination toward underrepresented groups. All academic and administrative departments at Carthage are committed to advancing equity and inclusion initiatives. The Office of Equity & Inclusion leads many of these programs, and serves as a central hub for students, faculty, staff, and administrators looking to advance their own cultural competency and advocacy work.
