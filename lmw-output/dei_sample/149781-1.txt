ThunderAthletics Wheaton College is a Christian liberal arts institution committed to treating all individuals as equal image-bearers of Jesus Christ. As followers of Christ, we seek to reflect, value, and promote a great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language. We affirm ethnic diversity as part of God’s original and eternal design for humanity and see its importance in knowing and worshiping God and serving his purposes in the world today. Consistent with the Scriptures, as well as Wheaton’s Community Covenant, Statement of Faith, and other policies, we believe that commitment to diversity, inclusion, justice, and unity is central to fulfilling the Great Commission, the Greatest Commandments, and Wheaton’s College Mission. We strive to cultivate a grace-filled, Christ-Centered academic community where all members are recognized, loved, and respected [Matthew 22:37-40 and 28:19-20; Revelation 7:9-10]. We acknowledge that our priorities have not always demonstrated our individual and collective dedication to affirm diversity, practice inclusion, seek justice, and pursue unity. Wheaton College was founded in part on its abolitionist vision. However, our institutional opposition to discrimination against people of color and women has not been consistently sustained in policy and practice. Because of Christ’s reconciling death on the cross, we repent of racism, sexism, and other divisive sins, and rededicate our energy and resources to creating an environment where all people know we are Christ-followers by the way we love one another [Mark 3:24-26; John 13-34-35; Ephesians 2:12-16; 1 John 1:7-8].

To demonstrate our commitment to diversity, we pledge to: Creating a campus climate where all faculty, staff, students, and alumni are included as full participants who feel welcomed, respected, valued, and supported [James 2:1-4; Romans 15:7]. To demonstrate our commitment to inclusion, we pledge to: To act for what is righteous, equitable, and fair in our shared life, academic programs, and campus administration [Psalm 89:14; Micah 6:8; Matthew 23:23; Luke 10:25-37]. To demonstrate our commitment to justice, we pledge to: To live and strive together in the Holy Spirit to become one in faith, affection and goals to fortify the Body of Christ [1 Corinthians 1:10; Ephesians 4:1-16; Psalm 133:1-3; John 17:20-23].
