The award is given to individuals who go “above and beyond to advance equity, access, diversity, inclusion and opportunity” for students in their schools and communities.” “I am deeply honored and humbled to receive this award among 29 other equity and access changemakers from across the country,” said Hollis. “This recognition is not just a reflection of my efforts, but a testament to the collective dedication of all those who are also champions and changemakers for diversity, equity, justice, access, and inclusion and who strive for fairness and inclusive excellence in education. “Together, we can continue to champion equity in higher education and build a socially just and more equitable future for all as we continue to strive for excellence in education, guided by the principles of access, equity, and inclusion.” Hollis serves on the advisory board of CCU’s Call Me MiSTER program, which recruits and retains male educators. She is the faculty fellow for the Edwards Center for Inclusive Excellence and director of P-12 educational equity initiatives with the Social Justice Research Initiative. She has served on committees and task forces and facilitated workshops on how to create an inclusive classroom environment, facilitate courageous conversations, write a diversity statement for the syllabus, and create a sense of belonging among minoritized students.
