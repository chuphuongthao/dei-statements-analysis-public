This is a reflection of Morris’s distinctive institutional history and our mission and vision as a public liberal arts college where dedicated faculty, staff and students work together to build more vibrant and inclusive communities. Breakdown of fall 2023 total enrollment by ethnicity: More detailed enrollment data Research suggests that living and learning in a diverse environment is beneficial to everyone. Groups of people who are more alike prompt less creative thought processes and yield less imaginative solutions. The opportunity to build relationships and learn with people from different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds supports better academic achievement because we encounter different ways of understanding the world and different ways of solving problems both large and small.  Opportunities provided at Morris to thrive in a diverse, close-knit community also lay the foundation for lifelong civic engagement and responsibility. The University of Minnesota is an equal opportunity educator and employer.
