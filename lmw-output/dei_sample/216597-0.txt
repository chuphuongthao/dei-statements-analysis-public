Diversity, equity and inclusion are integral components of the teaching and learning experience and an essential element of the ongoing intellectual, social and spiritual development of every member of the Villanova community. We believe that an inclusive community fosters an understanding and appreciation for diversity among our students, faculty, staff and administrators. We are committed to cultivating an academic environment that is marked by genuine curiosity about different perspectives, ardent receptivity to knowledge generated through intercultural connections, and a genuine sensitivity to the variety of human experiences. Community is at the core of the Villanova experience. It is through a diverse community of scholars and students—representing various viewpoints and experiences—that the Catholic intellectual tradition is best accomplished. The Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion works to address issues of equity and justice throughout our community. Villanova continues to work proactively to expand our welcome to all, embracing diversity in its multitude of forms, including race, gender, ability, ideology, orientation and socioeconomic status. Villanova actively seeks to foster an environment in which different perspectives are respected, and all voices are valued. The Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion currently offers a variety of workshops and lectures for faculty, staff or students that encourage self-reflection, understanding and individual growth. The Dr. Terry Nance Center for Dialogue engages the Villanova community in the practice of dialogue. Dialogue is a strategically facilitated and sustained group process where individuals learn the skills to engage in honest and dignifying conversations as they build relationships and community. ​         50 COUNTRIES REPRESENTED BYCURRENT STUDENTS 26 CULTURAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 7 CULTURAL AND INTERNATIONALSTUDIES PROGRAMS If you are concerned about any issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion, please do not hesitate to contact us.
