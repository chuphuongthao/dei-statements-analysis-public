We’re a welcoming community that champions diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) because it makes us all stronger. Syracuse University is fully committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive and respectful campus community. In the classroom and across campus, our commitment to diversity and inclusion is rooted in the belief that multiple points of view, life experiences, ethnicities, cultures and belief systems are essential to academic excellence. Having a space where our experiences are centered and where we can form community is important for many Indigenous students’ success. This dedicated space really sends a message that we have a presence on campus. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion sets priorities to advance equity for all across campus. We believe equity in thought, feeling and action fosters measurable diversity, full accessibility, true inclusivity and meaningful belonging. The Office of Multicultural Affairs supports, guides and encourages students to become members of a community that respects and connects across differences. EOIRS works with students, faculty and staff to foster a climate of inclusion, access and opportunity. STOP Bias and Hate is a university-wide initiative that educates the campus community about bias and hate and provides resources to report and receive support for bias-related or hate incidents. 900 South Crouse Ave. Syracuse, NY 13244
