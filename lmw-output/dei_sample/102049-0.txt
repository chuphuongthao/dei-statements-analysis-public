We assist minority students in achieving the highest scholarship possible by providing tutoring and other academic resources. We promote a sense of community by providing programming that enables the Samford community to grow and learn together. We foster a sense of pride in self and the Samford community by helping students, faculty, and staff recognize their investment in the university and the university’s investment in them. In 2020, Samford’s Task Force on Racial Justice was formed to assist the university in fostering positive, enduring changes in campus culture and existing systems so that racial justice may become a known attribute of the institution. As a follow-up measure to the work of the Task Force on Racial Justice, Samford launched the Diversity Action Planning Committee (DAPC) in 2021. The committee was tasked with developing a plan to implement the recommendations of the Task Force’s final report to create a more durable and accountable process to implement the report’s recommendations.
