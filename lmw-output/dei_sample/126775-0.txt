At Mines, we’re all about individuality, and we place a high value on out-of-the-box thinking.  After all, that’s how we make scientific breakthroughs and develop game-changing ideas. By providing support services and resources through diversity, equity, inclusion and access (DEIA) initiatives, we aim to nurture this thinking and work towards a more inclusive and equitable campus environment for students, staff and faculty alike.
