More information on Accessibility at UD In April, the U.S. Department of Educationannounced revisions to Title IX, a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. A federal court in Kansas—in the matter of Kansas v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., C.A. No. 24-4041 (D. Kan.)—issued an order temporarily enjoining the U.S. Department of Education from enforcing new Title IX regulations previously required to be implemented by schools on or before August 1, 2024. The Kansas order is unique in that it was not limited to certain states, but instead applies to any school attended by members of the Young America’s Foundation and Female Athletes United, regardless of the school’s location. The decision impacts over 700 colleges and universities across the United States, including the University of Delaware. The injunction creates challenges and uncertainties, as schools may chose to follow the 2024 Title IX regulations, while others may continue to adhere to the 2020 Title IX regulations for the time being. Schools must navigate this uncertain legal landscape, potentially adjusting their policies and other compliance measures based on ongoing legal developments. The University of Delaware will keep its current Non-Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Title IX Policy in place while it awaits further guidance from courts and the U.S. Department of Education. The University will, however, proceed with operational improvements that are informed by best practices and supported by both the 2020 and 2024 Title IX regulations, and will remain ready to implement the 2024 regulations when/if the injunction is lifted. An injunction is a court order that enjoins (i.e., blocks, stops, etc.) something from happening while litigation is ongoing. Many types of injunctions have been ordered by courts, including injunctions stopping enforcement of regulations (like in the Kansas case). As of August 1, 2024, the University of Delaware is the only Delaware school that is impacted by an injunction related to the 2024 Title IX regulations. There were multiple legal arguments made in lawsuits related to the injunctions. Those arguments include, but are not limited to, that the regulations force States to violate state laws, that the regulations may cause conflicts with First Amendment rights, that the Department of Education exceeded its scope of authority in issuing the 2024 Title IX regulations, that the regulations contradict the plain language of Title IX, that Title IX does not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, that the regulations require schools to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and that the regulations create a lower standard for sexual harassment, contrary to U.S. Supreme Court precedent.
