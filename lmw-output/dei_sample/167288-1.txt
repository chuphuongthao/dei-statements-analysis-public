 As a public liberal arts institution in the 21st century, MCLA understands that diversity,
                        equity, and inclusion must be a cornerstone on which our success lays. To that end,
                        the College is committed to creating an equitable and inclusive campus community where
                        all students, faculty, and staff have the knowledge, skills, and habits of mind necessary
                        to live in a diverse, globally integrated world. The Committee on Diversity, Equity,
                        and Inclusion (CDEI) is an integral aspect of this work. Comprised of members from across all academic/administrative support divisions, CDEI
                        serves as a leadership council working with the Senior Advisor for Institutional Equity
                        & Belonging to help the College achieve its goals of promoting diversity and institutionalizing
                        equity and inclusion as core values. Specifically, Senior Advisor for Institutional
                        Equity & Belonging assesses, monitors and reports on progress toward achieving strategic
                        diversity goals; and reviews and revises MCLA's diversity goals and strategies. Primary
                        areas of focus include (1) diversity of the faculty, staff, and student bodies; (2)
                        campus culture and climate; (3) curricular and co-curricular diversity-centered learning
                        opportunities; and (4) institutional practices and policies. The Committee, though part of the governance structure at the College, will mirror
                        earlier grassroots efforts in many ways. It is deeply concerned with radical inclusion
                        and will allow all community members the ability to have their voice heard as well
                        as get involved with equity work. This new committee is meant to provide a level of
                        accountability without sacrificing the transparent nature of its earlier iteration.

                        community members, and alum. Among other things, CDEI will: The broader Committee will convene at least four times per academic year with subgroup

                        and responding to feedback from members of the campus community. As advocates for
                        inclusion, the Committee values and promotes cross-collaboration; consults with faculty,
                        staff and campus offices; and regularly supports and participates in diversity enrichment
                        opportunities. Along with being composed of representatives from areas across the College, the membership
