  Inclusive Excellence views diversity, equity, and inclusion as the responsibility
                           of every member of the TCU community. A diverse and inclusive campus leads to innovation,
                           broadened perspectives, and social understanding, values that are foundational aspects
                           of higher education.  The Land that Became the TCU Campus Was Native Americans’ Home For Millennia. That’s
                           Important to Know.  TCU offers a variety of programs and resources to support LGBTQ+ Horned Frogs and
                           allies, creating a campus environment where everyone can thrive.  The Race & Reconciliation Initiative is an academically-based, historically-focused
                           initiative designed to investigate and document TCU's relationship with slavery, racism,
                           and the Confederacy.
