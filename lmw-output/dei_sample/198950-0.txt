Meredith College is committed to fostering an inclusive and pluralistic campus environment where diverse identities are safe and welcomed into our learning and working community. The College is committed to actively addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in all departments and administrative processes. The College admits undergraduate women students of any age, race, creed, sexual orientation, national and ethnic origin. In alignment with our core values and our mission as a women’s college, the College respects race, ethnicity, culture, sex, gender identity, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, ability, age, national origin, immigration status, veteran status, political affiliation, religion, and spiritual identity that enrich and ennoble our campus conversations, relationships, classrooms, co-curricular programs, and work environments. Our community appreciates that identity is intersectional and that diversity extends beyond this incomplete list of categories. The College strives to cultivate a climate of respect and dialogue around these aspects of identity. Meredith adheres to a comprehensive non-discrimination policy that recognizes differences and acknowledges that these differences are valued assets that enrich our community.
