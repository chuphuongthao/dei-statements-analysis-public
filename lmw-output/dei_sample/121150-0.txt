At Pepperdine, we know our Christian heritage compels every community member to do
                  justice, love kindness, and walk humbly (Micah 6:8). Doing justice requires us to
                  treat every human being with fairness, respect and compassion. Loving kindness means
                  that we seek to help each other as best we can, value each others’ God-given gifts,
                   and address each other with love, respect, and empathy—assuming the best of intentions.
                  Walking humbly means as beneficiaries of God’s love and grace, we should exemplify
                  that grace and love toward each other by putting others ahead of ourselves. Our humility
                  should help us discern that we all grow through hearing and reflecting upon viewpoints,
                  academic disciplines, and cultures that diverge from ours. Honoring God’s direction provides our best opportunity to discern God’s truth. When
                  we do this, we exemplify and promote a sense of belonging at Pepperdine, which is
                  critical for enabling all Waves to live, work, and study in an environment where they
                  are prepared to pursue excellent lives of purpose, service, and leadership.    Highlights, updates, events, media, recommendations, and accomplishments in the areas
                           of diversity, equity, and community belonging. For questions and feedback, please
