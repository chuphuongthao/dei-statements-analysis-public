 The Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) coordinates university-wide EDI efforts and collaborates with university leaders to create, implement, and evaluate programs designed to ensure every single community member can grow and thrive together. We partner with campus schools and non-academic units to craft a vision for EDI that is unique to the Tulane community, and accountable to our place in New Orleans, the Gulf Region, and the world. In doing so, we engage our Tulane community in crucial, brave conversations about the most challenging issues of our times - including the impacts of racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, classism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, Xenophobia, and other intersectional societal inequities â€“ to identify social change efforts we can make now and in the future. On this website, you can find our EDI Office activities, initiatives, and resources and get connected to those across campus.
