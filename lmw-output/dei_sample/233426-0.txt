Through diverse educational, cultural and social programs, we're building a more diverse community of students. The P.E.A.C.E. (Proficiency, Education, Advocacy, Civility, and Equity) framework is comprehensive, flexible, and designed to provide our campus with a sustainable and attainable format for incorporating diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging into the Roanoke College fiber. We desire for all members of our community to live authentically and be accepted for who they are, starting at the very heart of their identity—their name.
