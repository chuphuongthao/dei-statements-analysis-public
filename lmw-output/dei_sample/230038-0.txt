Covenant Belonging at BYU Belonging is more than just being included. It is the embodiment of Christ-like love based on the belief that we are all children of God, with unique experiences, gifts, and talents.It means gathering as a covenant community, being committed to serving and sacrificing, and centering our lives on Jesus Christ.Through covenant belonging we are bound to God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ and to each other.A sense of belonging is important to our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, and to achieving our shared objective of establishing Zion. The Office of Belonging was created to assist BYU in constructing "a community of belonging composed of students, faculty, and staff whose hearts are knit together in love" (Statement on Belonging) and to teach the world how to use gospel principles to create unified communities.
