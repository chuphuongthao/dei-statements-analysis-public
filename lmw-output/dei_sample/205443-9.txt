X Close Campus Life/Title IX/Diversity Series The offices of Intercultural Student Belonging, Title IX, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion partnered to present a Diversity Series. The series focused on topics such as a sense of belonging, how we impact others, trauma, microaggressions and social justice in the form of storytelling and reflection. The storytelling piece gives both students and employees the opportunity to share what they have to say regarding certain topics and prompts with those around them. On the other hand, the reflection piece gives others the chance to reflect and respond to those stories via written responses, artwork, poems, and any other expressive form. This project was sponsored by the Ohio Department of Higher Education Cultivating Liberation Grant and the SSU Development Foundation.
