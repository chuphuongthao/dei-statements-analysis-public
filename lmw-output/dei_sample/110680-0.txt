We take a proactive approach to cultivating a welcoming environment for all—because excellence is only attainable when everyone is included, respected and empowered. We invite you to engage in self-reflection and dialogue at one of our campus community centers, join our cultural celebrations and become a social justice leader. The campus community centers support your academic success by providing co-curricular learning experiences that promote self-awareness, foster leadership development, encourage dialogue, and challenge traditional notions of diversity. Through campus partnerships, we build and sustain a socially just campus climate. From performance groups and art collectives to social clubs and community building coalitions, explore over 65 student organizations dedicated to culture.
