                        James Roosevelt Bayley founded Seton Hall, he envisioned a home for the mind, the
                        heart, and the spirit. Today, we celebrate a diverse tapestry of ideas and perspectives
                        that enrich the dialogue and academic discussion in the classroom. We are proud that
                        our diversity stimulates innovative teaching and learning, and believe that it prepares
                        our students to live and work in a global society. The statue of Elizabeth Ann Seton
                        at the heart of our campus is a daily reminder of the kind of community we strive
                        to beâ€”one that recognizes the dignity of all, welcomes each student fully, and treasures
                        their gifts. Seton Hall University attracts students from every corner of the United States and
                        from more than 70 countries around the world. Nearly 40 percent of our undergraduates
                        identify themselves as students of color. Outside of the U.S., China, Colombia, India,
                        Saudi Arabia and Thailand are the most represented countries at the University. View the most recent emails sent to the Seton Hall community from the DEI Committee: Follow #SetonHall
