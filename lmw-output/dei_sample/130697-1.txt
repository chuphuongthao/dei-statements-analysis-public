Our campus community sees difference as an asset.We value our faculty, staff, students, visitors, and friends of Wesleyan, and promote diversity and inclusion across our entire organization. We are a team of individuals working collectively and committed to creating a culture of respect, equity, and inclusion.Â  We believe this is the responsibility of each member of our campus and work with all constituents to that end.  x4771 wburnhamwill@wesleyan.edu  x2456 dcolucci@wesleyan.edu  x2151 aruiz01@wesleyan.edu  x3979 dcolvin@wesleyan.edu  x2320   x3165 rhendrix@wesleyan.edu  x4771 pblount@wesleyan.edu  x3186 mperalta@wesleyan.edu     x3194 jromine@wesleyan.edu     x2435 nvazquezrosa@wesleyan.edu     x2970 awhite04@wesleyan.edu  x2121     You are using a unsupported browser.
