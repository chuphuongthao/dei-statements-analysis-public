Cultivating the wholeness of person requires an environment that promotes and nurtures a genuine love of learning. We embrace a diversity that means encountering ways of life which, by definition, opens our minds by introducing us to differences in experiences and outlooks that prepare us for living and learning in an increasingly global community. As a part of Wittenberg's diverse residential community we value diversity because it enriches our university community and prepares us to fully appreciate how diversity contributes to our growth as human beings. We believe that such encounters, in this learning community, will go on to cultivate a campus culture in which a wide range of talents and perspectives are fostered and celebrated. Recognizing the humanity of people regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender as well as gender expression and sexual orientation, we commit ourselves to work as social change agents by promoting mutual support and respect for diversity.
