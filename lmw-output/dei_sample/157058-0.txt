                              and core value is incorporated into our teaching, learning, research, outreach, operations,
                              and decision making. Everyone contributes to an inclusive climate by implementing practices guided by standards
                              and behaviors that demonstrate a respect for individual’s identity, diversity, and
                              needs to reach their full potential.  Kentucky State University is committed nurturing the next generation of diverse professionals
                                    who will work to resolve economic, social, political, and technological challenges

                                    pathway to creating safe and nurturing environments where everyone belongs and can
                                    thrive.   (502) 597-6813 admissions@kysu.edu (502) 597-6278 bursarmail@kysu.edu (502) 597-5960 finaidmail@kysu.edu ©2024 Kentucky State University. All rights reserved.An Equal Opportunity University.
