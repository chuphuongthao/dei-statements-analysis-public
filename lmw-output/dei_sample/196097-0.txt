At Stony Brook University, we define the rich diversity of our students, faculty,
                                       clinicians and staff to be both a defining characteristic and an essential source
                                       of strength for our campus community. As the Nation evolves, the terms “diversity”, “equity” and “inclusion” (DEI) have
                                       progressed to represent persons from a growing array of backgrounds, cultures, identities
                                       and experiences, to name a few. DEI is dynamic, not static, therefore we are committed to progressively reflecting
                                       the values, changes and understanding that a diverse learning environment benefits
                                       everyone.
