Breaking Ground: Native and Indigenous Professionals’ Speaker Seriesby Virginia Hart, Tiffany Hale, and Tiffany Thimba Since Barnard College was founded and sits on Lenape land, it is imperative to actively challenge our institution’s history by prioritizing and elevating the voices of Native and Indigenous communities. This speaker series will center the lived experiences of both Native and Indigenous professionals and members of the Barnard community by providing a platform for them to share their stories, insights, and expertise. The inaugural panel will bring Native and Indigenous women to campus who have navigated a professional pathway while maintaining a strong connection to their cultural identity. This series aims to inspire and empower current students, particularly the 2% who identify as Native American and/or Indigenous, as well as foster the Native American and Indigenous (NAIS) Studies program. 2. Exploring Disability Identity Development Through Filmby Bailie Gregory, Jord Barnett, Daisy Friedman, Sofie Chu DeChristofaro, and Mariam Sikiru This project explores how various members of the Barnard community (staff, students, alumni, and faculty) construct their own identities as disabled people. To that aim, this team of students will develop a film that explores the relationship between disability identity development and how the Barnard community shapes the development of disabled identity. The project will culminate into a screening of the documentary aimed to encourage participants to think about how they might view their own identities, as well as to think about how they may be able to engage with those identities to create better communities. In addition to the documentary, the team will create an accessibility resource guide to pair with the film to further foster conversations across campus. 3. Gender* in the Archives, 2nd phaseby Martha Tenney This project seeks to extend and continue theGender* in the Archives oral historyand documentation project started by Adam Johnson ‘25 and Carson Stachura ‘23 in 2022 where they collected oral histories and written responses from trans and nonbinary Barnard students and recent graduates and submitted them to the archives. The second stage of Gender* in the Archives aims to collect more interviews and documentation, as well as host additional events and gathering spaces. This project will renew outreach to trans and nonbinary alums to fill in gaps in archival documentation of earlier generations of student organizing. If possible, interviews will also be conducted of current trans and nonbinary Barnard staff and faculty. The project will culminate in a Movement Lab installation and to offer other spaces and support for trans and nonbinary students to gather. 4. Nourishing Rootsby Gisella Castagna Nourishing Roots aims to connect Asian-Americans in the Barnard community over a series of monthly meals together during the 2024-2025 academic year. Students will participate in meaningful dialogue that explores the cultural, political, and historical forces that shape their roles within the Asian-American community and amongst marginalized people. In Asian and Asian-American culture, food is essential to fostering community, connecting with one’s culture, and bridging people of different backgrounds, geographies and generations. Food has united Asian-Americans throughout colonial occupation, wars, and isolation from immigration. There will be 8 monthly meals over the course of the year, each focusing on a different topic: 1) Colonial History, 2) Immigrant History and Experience, 3) The Intersection between Race and Class, 4) The Intersection between Race and Gender/Sexual Identity, 5) Mental Health and Generational Trauma, 6) Asian American Activism, 7) Inter-Asian-American Solidarity, and 8) Asian American Solidarity with other groups. CU AAPI members will facilitate these discussions and invite a few keynote speakers who may offer insights from their expertise to inspire and guide participants.    Members of theShange Magic Projectfor their idea The Love Space Demands: Sharing the Words of Ntozake Shange in the Barnard Library, which will support the installation of excerpts from the work of Ntozake Shange ’70 on walls around the Milstein Center. Xiang Ji ‘22 launched Barnard Signs the Way, conceived and led by Columbia/Barnard’s Sign Language Club [CU Sign]–for a weekend of hybrid workshops, panels, and art excursions in Fall 2022, with and for Deaf advocates and artists. With this intensified program, the project aims to expose the entire Columbia University community to Deaf-Studies-oriented events, and artworks of Deaf artists, and to connect different departments and programs such as Teachers College’s Deaf Education program and Columbia Medical Center’s Department of Otolaryngology. Since 2008, CU Sign is the only student club and extracurricular resource for Columbia undergraduates to learn American Sign Language (ASL). Their programming attracts a very high number of Barnard students as the proportion of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students at Barnard College is double of the CDC national average of 0.1%. Professor Gabri Christa received a grant in support of The Moving Body-Moving Image Festival which has been organized since 2018 as a biennial social justice film festival at Barnard College. It was conceived and started by Gabri Christa, Director of the Movement Lab, and organized every two years with a different theme. It is the only social justice-oriented festival that is part of Screendance.The 2022 iteration of the festivalwas on the “Moving Body with Disabilities,” and took place between March 28-April 3, 2022. The festival program consisted of live screening events, a live installation, and a week-long online screening access to all Festival films. The Grant supported part of the costs of speaker fees, workshop fees, the screening rights of the films, and the creation of audio descriptions for all of the films screened at the festival. This grant is open toall Barnard students, faculty, and staffapplying individually or in groups. Check back for the next cycle in Spring 2025. Check back for the next cycle in Spring 2025. 1. Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex A staff-led project,T 4 Teais a recurring tea party event for trans students to meet, hang out and relax. The initiative centers rest, play and growth.T 4 Teaevents aim to improve the well-being of the trans community at Barnard. The activities of each event are shaped in line with the interests of the participants. Examples of activities include sharing trans history through various media, learning and improving camera skills, karaoke, drawing, creating playlists and listening to music, clothing swaps and fashion shows, and intergenerational conversations between trans students and trans staff.  Sponsored by Access Barnard and the Office of Development and Alumnae Relations, this collaborative project aims to provide sustained support for international students who spend their Thanksgiving breaks in New York. Through the annual Millie’s Thanksgiving Homestay Program, local alumnae will be invited to participate in the project as volunteer hosts, and will have the chance to connect with and spend the holiday with international students. The primary goals of the program are assisting international students with expanding their support network; keeping alumnae engaged in the campus community; and supporting the building of meaningful connections and experiences across the Barnard community. Students and hosts will be matched based on the information provided in their applications. The grant funding will be used to cover the transportation costs of students. The project acknowledges the fact that the traditional American Thanksgiving, which is broadly about being thankful, is historically rooted in the glorification of colonialism and genocide in North America. The project leader(s) is/are keen on informing students about the histories of the American Indigenous peoples, and the genocides, displacements, and forms of oppression to which they have been subjected by the colonizers and settlers. 2. T 4 Tea This interactive exhibition project focuses on the activist legacy of Grace Lee Boggs, a Chinese American Barnard alumna (BC ‘35). The project is inspired by the following questions: how might the Barnard community engage with and learn from Boggs’s community activism, efforts in building inter- and intra-community dialogue, and commitment to multiple underrepresented communities? How might a closer understanding of her life and work help expand our current community’s ideas and efforts related to leadership in an unjust world? The exhibition will feature digital research projects created by students in the Spring 2023 Grace Lee Boggs Learning Lab, which is taught by Dr. Akhtar and Dr. Kitzmiller. 3. Millie’s Thanksgiving Homestay Program In 2025, Barnard College will celebrate the admittance of Zora Neale Hurston ‘28, Barnard’s first step towards racial integration, and a 100-year tradition of Black scholarship. Barnard’s reputation for nurturing intelligent and ambitious graduates extended to its Black alums; many prominent and accomplished Black women call Barnard their alma mater. Yet, this legacy is not without its complications. Barnard was the second to last of the Seven Sisters to integrate. Hurston was already a Howard University graduate and in her thirties when she was admitted, with a level of accomplishment not necessary for her white peers. Decades later, while other schools steadily increased their Black populations, there was a rumored quota on Black students at Barnard. As the years continued, and Barnard’s policies evolved, the changing social, economic, and political landscape meant that Black students were never without their struggles to integrate, revolutionize, and overcome the challenges of white supremacy, misogyny, and other intersectional oppressions on and off campus. A century later Black Barnard students continue to face the isolation of minority status and the pressure of excellence that comes with it. This grant supports interviews with Black alums directed by writer, producer, and media artist Nia Ashley (Barnard '16). Black at Barnard seeks to collect the stories of as many Black students who attended Barnard in the last 100 years (1925-2025) as possible. The Barnard College Archive will acquire full unedited interviews for their Oral History collection. For a related documentary project, Ashley's interviews with Black alums interviews, expert commentary, and historical research will illustrate the complicated history of Black students at Barnard over the last 100 years. 4. The Life and Legacy of Grace Lee Boggs This book launch event is titled after the book edited by Justice Roe Williams, Roc Rochon and Lawrence Koval (2023). Through the lenses of QTBIPOC activism, fat liberation and disability movements, the event aims to create a critical and enriching space of conversation on what it means to be fit in the United States, and on how to more meaningfully engage with the wide variety of fitness and joyful movement. The panel will be followed by a 45-minute, moderated Q&A, and an hour-long Rooted Resistance movement session led by Roc Rochon. Rooted Resistance is a grassroots practice that aims to reimagine and create wellness spaces for trans, non-binary and queer people who often feel repressed, invisible, or overly visible. This will be a free event for Barnard and Columbia communities, and will also be open to the public. 5.

A student-led project,Bodies in the Borderlandsaims to initiate a community space for trans and genderqueer students at Barnard College. The planned outcomes are a zine series, and a mixed media installation based on interviews conducted with trans and genderqueer students. The project aspires to contribute to the level of awareness on campus about the trans and genderqueer experiences, and about forms of communication, which would not only enhance inclusivity and equity in learning, but also support the well-being of gender-noncomforming students. The project will continue in Fall 2022. 1st zine:Arisaema The Grant supportsBarnard Signs the Way–conceived and led by Columbia/Barnard’s Sign Language Club [CU Sign]–for a weekend of hybrid workshops, panels, and art excursions in Fall 2022, with and for Deaf advocates and artists.

Akaraka is a student-led community programming project that aims to connect Africans on campus with African immigrants in the New York area, and in the diaspora. The project is named after an Igbo word of the Igbo tribe in Nigeria, and it connotes having control over one’s destiny. Emphasizing the interconnectivity of individual and collective destinies, several events and community gatherings were organized in Spring 2022 in order to foster intra-communal exchange of knowledge and experiences, exposure to the artworks of African communities, and community enjoyment. The Grant supported community gatherings at African restaurants in Harlem, a film screening collaboration [Farewell Amor, Ekwa Msangi, 2020] between Barnard College and African Film Festival at Maysles Documentary Center in Harlem, and the 2022 Afropolitan event in the Event Oval.

A project co-sponsored by the Writing and Speaking Fellows Program and the Center for Engaged Pedagogy (CEP),Language and the Classroomaims to engage the Barnard community in a conversation about language, and racially-biased, gendered, or otherwise structurally-informed perceptions of rhetorics in the classroom. The project leaders aim to initiate a conversation about how the Barnard community can think about the complications and possibilities of linguistic justice every time faculty members ask students to write, discuss, or present, and every time they grade, assess, and comment on a students’ rhetorical expression.Assist. Prof. Dr. Laura Gonzaleswill give a workshop, and facilitate a conversation on linguistic justice in Spring 2023.  As a one-time support initiative, the Grant funds part of the speaker's fee. Suitable Suitsis a Beyond Barnard initiative for students to borrow professional attire when they have in-person or virtual job interviews, and when they want to attend networking events. As a one-time support initiative, the Grant funds part ofSuitable Suits’s plans (1) to expand their clothing options to include pieces that will allow trans and genderqueer students to authentically self-present in professional settings, and (2) to eliminate the dry cleaning fees that currently render students responsible for returning the attire in clean condition–in order to provide a more equitable support for First-Generation and Low-Income (FLI) students.
