Heritage Month Celebrations In celebration of the histories and contributions of historically marginalized identities, Student Diversity & Inclusion commemorates heritage months throughout the year. Welcome Days Reception Our opening weekend event invites students of color, undocumented students, first-generation college students and LGBTQ+ students to meet and build relationships. First-Generation Day Student Diversity & Inclusion helps lead UD’s annual First-Generation Celebration Luncheon in honor of National First-Generation Day on November 8. As a presidential priority, the University of Delaware built the Center for Intercultural Engagement (CIE) to provide a physical space where students can interact, explore and grow together around social justice, equity, diversity and inclusion. Learn more about the CIE Be on the lookout every month for the Student Diversity & Inclusion newsletter featuring upcoming DEIJ events, programs, services and much more!
