Students can choose from a variety of campus community organizations focused on social, cultural, and ethnic interests and identities. Several community groups are based out of the Office of Identity, Student Engagement, and Access (ISEA).  At Clark, we work every day to build an inclusive learning environment that links with our academic mission to build new knowledge and seek truth everywhere. Our university is dynamic, multicultural, and always striving to be better. We believe each student deserves a learning experience that merges the distinctiveness of the individual with the power of community. Your perspectives, your talents, your history, and your voice are critical toward sustaining a campus that celebrates difference and fosters respect for all. The Center for Gender, Race, and Area Studies is an academic hub comprising interdisciplinary programs, from Africana Studies to Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies. As part of its liberal arts curriculum, Clark requires all students to fulfill a Diversity and Inclusion course requirement.
