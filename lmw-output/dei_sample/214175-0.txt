  As an institution and as individual members of a campus community, we believe it is our shared responsibility to build and support an environment for living, learning and working at Muhlenberg in which everyone is welcomed as their full selves inclusive of their diverse social identities and lived experiences. Our efforts are led by dedicated colleagues who provide support for our collective efforts by providing vision, strategy and expertise in our diversity, equity and inclusion work with students, staff and faculty.  The grant, aimed at improving college access and success for students eligible for federal Pell grants, will allow the College to expand its highly successful Emerging Leaders Program. This year, Muhlenberg College is celebrating Black History Month by uplifting mental health and wellness initiatives focused on supporting Black communities. Students in the online graduate certificate program had the opportunity to meet in person and consider practical ways of fostering understanding and collaboration in diverse environments. Twenty senior diversity leaders from liberal arts colleges visited campus earlier this month for three days of connecting and exchanging ideas. Â©Muhlenberg College
