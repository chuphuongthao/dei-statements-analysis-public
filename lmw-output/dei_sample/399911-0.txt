The mission of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is to partner with all university constituents to foster respect and appreciation for diversity, a commitment to equity, and the realization of a culture where every community member feels a genuine sense of belonging. This is accomplished by supporting and cultivating individuals who embody the characteristics of a global citizen and ensuring that the Soka community continues its ever-evolving development, grounded in dignity and respect for each individual. Core Values “SUA is a microcosm of a future world in which outstanding intellects from many different cultural backgrounds will gather in friendship and harmonious coexistence. Our university is the hope of the human race, fostering great leaders who will unite the world with the treasure of humanity, transcending all barriers of nationality, ethnicity, and cultural background.” —Daisaku Ikeda 1 University Drive, Aliso Viejo, CA 92656
