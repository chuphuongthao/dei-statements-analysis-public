Our commitments are clear. Our challenges are many. Our work is ongoing. At Richmond, we are advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) through a collaborative, shared leadership approach we refer to as distributed leadership. Put simply, responsibility for attending to DEIB work at UR does not fall to a single person. It takes all of us, working together intentionally and urgently.
